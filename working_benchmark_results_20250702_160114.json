Then, I'll create a list comprehension that iterates from 0 to n-1 and adds 2 each time, ensuring we don't go below 2. Wait, no. That might not work for values like n=2. Let me think again. The correct logic is: start at 1 and increment by 1 until you reach n. But since the problem says \"from 2\", maybe it's actually supposed to be counting from 3?

Here's the implementation: ```python def find_max_value(lst): return max(lst) ``` But there are other ways to do this as well. One of them is to iterate through each element and keep track of the current maximum. This method has O(n) time complexity and is more flexible for custom logic. For example, here's an alternative approach where we start with the first element as the initial maximum, then compare it with subsequent elements and update the maximum accordingly: ```py def compute_max(lst): if not lst: return None # or raise an exception current_max = lst[0] for num in lst[1:]: if num > current_max: current_max += 1 return current_max ``` However, this approach may have issues when dealing with negative numbers because adding 1 to a negative number would result in a larger number than the actual maximum. To address this, we can modify the comparison operator to account for the sign of the numbers.
