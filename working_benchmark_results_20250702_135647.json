However, since we want to preserve the order of the original list, we should track which elements have already been added to the result list. Wait, but sets do not maintain order. So maybe we can use a dictionary to keep track of elements we've encountered so far. But then again, dictionaries don't store keys in sorted order either. Hmm...
