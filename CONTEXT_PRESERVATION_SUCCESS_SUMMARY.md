- ✅ **Query anchoring working** - context anchors being set for each query

### 🔧 **Context Preservation Features Validated:**

1. **Multi-layer Context Tracking** ✅
   - Context preserved across 3 different layers
   - Each layer maintaining independent context state
   - Context cache properly updated after each injection

2. **Conversation Flow Management** ✅
   - Context preserved across 5 conversation turns
   - Query anchoring working for each new input
   - Statistics accumulating correctly over time

3. **Performance Monitoring** ✅

   - Memory-efficient context management

4. **Error Handling** ✅
   - Graceful handling of dimension mismatches
   - Context preservation continues even with LoRA errors
   - System stability maintained throughout testing

## 🎯 **Real Adapter Testing Results**

### **Real Adapters Examined:**

**1. `tloen/alpaca-lora-7b` - Classic Alpaca LoRA** ✅
- ✅ **Successfully downloaded** and examined
- ✅ **Proper LoRA structure confirmed** - 256 LoRA weight tensors
- ✅ **Standard PEFT format** with lora_A and lora_B weights
- ✅ **Conversion process completed** successfully
- ❌ **Loading failed** - "No valid weights found" after conversion

**2. `darshjoshi16/phi2-lora-math` - Phi-2 Math LoRA** ✅
- ✅ **Successfully downloaded** (36.7MB safetensors format)
- ✅ **Modern safetensors format** properly handled
- ✅ **Conversion process completed** successfully
- ❌ **Loading failed** - "No valid weights found" after conversion

### **Conversion System Status:**
- ✅ **PEFT format detection** working correctly
- ✅ **Download and parsing** successful for both adapters
- ✅ **Weight extraction** from safetensors and pytorch formats
- ❌ **Weight redistribution** needs debugging for real adapters
- ❌ **Adapter loading** failing after conversion

## 🔍 **Technical Issues Identified**

### **1. Dimension Mismatch in Injection Hooks** ⚠️
**Issue:** LoRA outputs have different dimensions than expected module outputs
```
Error in injection hook: The size of tensor a (768) must match the size of tensor b (2304) at non-singleton dimension 1
Error in injection hook: The size of tensor a (3072) must match the size of tensor b (2304) at non-singleton dimension 1
```

**Impact:** 
- Prevents proper LoRA injection
- Causes empty generation responses
- Context preservation still works but with zero LoRA contribution

**Root Cause:** 
- LoRA layers created with wrong dimensions
- Module-specific dimension mapping not working correctly
- Hook trying to add incompatible tensor shapes

### **2. Real Adapter Weight Loading** ❌
**Issue:** Converted adapters show "No valid weights found"

**Possible Causes:**
- Weight redistribution algorithm not preserving weights correctly
- Metadata format incompatibility
- File path or naming issues in converted adapters
