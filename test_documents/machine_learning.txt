Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn
and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through interaction and feedback

Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

Machine learning is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, 
natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
